Dependencies

Notebooks reproducing COBRApy results require the following. 

(1) *COBRApy* version 0.25.0
The authors used CPLEX with an academic license for the solver. Solvers can be set or changed as shown below.

model.solver = 'cplex'

COBRApy can also use glpk (open source) or Gurobi (academic license available) solvers.

Notebooks reproducing ReFramed results require the following. 

(2) *ReFramed* version 1.2.1
The authors used CPLEX with an academic license for the solver. 

ReFramed can also use Gurobi. There is also an OptLang interface allowing for a larger selection of solvers.
